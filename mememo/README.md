# MeMeMo

Find the mean, median, and mode of a list of integers.

## Notes

My implementation is far from complete and well tested. I'm using this a means to learn the language, and less as a means of slathering technical correctness over every inch of the problem.

TODO:

* Stop assuming a sorted slice of ints when calculating median
* Add more test cases (and then probably more TODOs)
